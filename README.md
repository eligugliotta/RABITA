RĀBIṬA is a research project funded under Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) – Mission 4 “Education and Research”, Component 2 “From Research to Business”, Investment 1.2 “Funding for projects presented by young researchers”, with resources from the European NextGenerationEU funds. The project is based at the University of Sassari, under the direction of Dr. Elisa Gugliotta ([Department of History, Human Sciences and Education](https://www.dissuf.uniss.it/it/ricerca/aree-di-ricerca)).

### The project title, RĀBIṬA, is an Arabic word (رابطة) meaning bond, connection, or union.
*In this project, the term carries a dual symbolic meaning: on the one hand, it represents the connection between texts, data, and digital tools, with the goal of building interoperable resources; on the other hand, it evokes the link between languages, people, and cultures, reflecting the deeply intercultural and humanistic nature of the initiative.*

### Project purpose


RĀBIṬA aims to bridge the gap between traditional educational tools and interoperable digital resources for the Arabic language. The project plans to create an open-access, digitally annotated corpus of Arabic literary texts, suitable both for university-level teaching and for linguistic and computational research.

### Project purpose

RĀBIṬA aims to bridge the gap between traditional educational tools and interoperable digital resources for the Arabic language. The project plans to create an open-access, digitally annotated corpus of Arabic literary texts, suitable both for university-level teaching and for linguistic and computational research.

### Main objectives

* Collection and selection of open-access Arabic texts suitable for different levels of language proficiency according to the CEFR, relevant for teaching Arabic language and literature.
* Textual annotation and normalization to ensure consistency, readability, and preparation of texts for automatic analysis.
* Standardized markup with linguistic, philological, and didactic metadata, to enable interoperability with Digital Humanities tools and resources.
* Design of interactive educational pathways based on the encoded texts.
<br />

* Analysis of the image contents (Image_activity, Image_object, Image_context).
* Gender classification (Gender_label): Classification by gender of the image subjects (male/female/mixed).

The last levels of analysis were performed only on the "human SAND sub-corpus". This subset includes posts where a human subject was recognized and classified in the "Gender_label" column. Posts without a human subject are labeled "No_human" in the "Gender_label" column. For these "non-human" posts, the three columns for image content analyses contain the token "_not_analyzed_" to indicate that these analyses were not performed.
  
### Resources and impact

The project, which started in May 2025, is scheduled to run until May 2027 and includes:

* The creation of freely accessible lexical and textual digital resources for teachers, students, and researchers.

* The development of innovative teaching practices based on interoperable digital resources and on integrating digital humanities into Arabic learning pathways.

* Scientific dissemination of results in national and international journals.

### Research team

The project brings together an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional team:

At the University of Sassari, alongside Dr. Elisa Gugliotta, Dr. Maura Tarquini is involved as a postdoctoral research fellow in the academic sector STAA-01/L (formerly L-OR/12) – Arabic Language and Literature, funded by the project. Her work is central to developing the corpus, managing the data, and modeling the resources according to open standards, as an expert in Arabic dialectology.
The project involves collaboration with the CNR-ILC (Institute for Computational Linguistics “A. Zampolli”), in particular with researchers [Francesca Frontini](https://www.ilc.cnr.it/people/francesca-frontini-2/) and [Fahad Khan](https://www.ilc.cnr.it/people/anas-fahad-khan-2/), to monitor the FAIRification processes of linguistic and educational materials and their sharing through the [H2IOSC training platform](https://h2iosc-training-platform.ilc4clarin.ilc.cnr.it/), while also exploring the possibility of developing lexical and semantic modeling of colloquial Arabic varieties from the collected data, in line with Linked Open Data (LOD) principles.
